# St.ranac

Website for domestic brand called St.ranac created as part of CS412 Web Application Development course at International University of Sarajevo. Since the aim of project was to create only frontend part of website, project doesn't include backend functionalities (apart from few functions that are used to store data from form fields into Firebase Cloud Firestore). There are plans to implement backend part as well as to add more functionalities on client side.

Frontend part of application is created using ReactJS and CSS. For backend part NodeJS (Express) and Firebase are used.
